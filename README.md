# Phishing Detection via Feature Extraction and XGBoost

This repository provides a lightweight pipeline for detecting phishing addresses on Ethereum using structured features and XGBoost classification. You may either use our preprocessed dataset or generate features from your own data.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### ðŸ”¹ Option 1: Use our provided dataset

If you would like to quickly try out the model using our preprocessed data, simply run:

```bash
python XGB.py
This will train and evaluate the XGBoost model on our dataset.

ðŸ”¹ Option 2: Use your own dataset
If you wish to apply the pipeline to your own data, follow these steps:

Run feature extraction:
```bash
python Feature_acquisition.py

Run skip-gram encoding (optional, for behavioral/semantic embeddings):
```bash
python skip_gram/skip_gram.py

These scripts will generate a .csv file containing extracted features.

Train the model:
```bash
python XGB.py
Make sure your generated CSV is correctly referenced in XGB.py.
